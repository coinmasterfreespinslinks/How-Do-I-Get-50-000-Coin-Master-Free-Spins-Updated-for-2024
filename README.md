### What is Coin Master?

Coin Master is a popular mobile game that blends slot machine mechanics with village-building gameplay. Players spin a virtual slot machine to earn coins, attack or raid other players' villages, and complete sets of cards to build and upgrade their own village. The game is free to play but relies heavily on spins and cards to progress.

Spins are the most critical aspect of the game. They allow you to earn coins, attack other players‚Äô villages, raid for treasure, and unlock chests containing cards. Because spins are limited, players often seek out ways to earn free spins to help them advance without having to spend real money.
